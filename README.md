* Completed a job simulation involving identity and access management (IAM) for Tata Consultancy Services, collaborating with a Cybersecurity Consulting team.
* Acquired expertise in IAM principles, cybersecurity best practices, and strategic alignment with business objectives.
* Delivered comprehensive documentation and presentations, showcasing the ability to communicate complex technical concepts effectively.

## 1. Enhancing User Lifecycle Management
### Automated Provisioning and De-provisioning:
- Implement an IAM solution with robust automation capabilities.
- Use workflows that trigger account creation and access rights assignment upon
hiring.
- Automate de-provisioning upon termination to immediately revoke access.
Integration with HR Systems:
- Integrate IAM with HR systems to streamline onboarding/offboarding.
- Ensure real-time synchronization of user data and status changes.
### Self-service Portals:
- Provide self-service portals for users to request access and manage profiles.
- Reduce IT workload and expedite access requests through approval workflows.
### Role-based Templates:
- Create role-based access templates to standardize permissions for common job
functions.
- Simplify the assignment of access rights during onboarding.
### Audit and Compliance:
- Implement continuous monitoring and auditing of user access.
- Ensure compliance with internal policies and regulatory requirements.

## 2. Strengthening Access Control Mechanisms
### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
- Define roles and associated access rights based on job functions.
- Ensure that users only have access to the resources necessary for their roles.

### Least Privilege Principle:
- Enforce least privilege access by regularly reviewing and adjusting permissions.
- Implement just-in-time (JIT) access for temporary access needs.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
- Deploy MFA for all sensitive and critical systems.

- Utilize MFA methods such as SMS, email, biometric, or authenticator apps.

### Policy Enforcement and Monitoring:
- Implement policies to enforce strong passwords and regular password changes.
- Monitor access patterns and flag anomalies for further investigation.

### Secure Access to Cloud Services:
- Integrate IAM with cloud services for centralized management.
- Ensure secure access controls and consistent policies across on-premises and
cloud environments.
